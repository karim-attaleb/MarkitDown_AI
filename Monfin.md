# On-Premises Lakehouse Architecture for MonFin with dbt

## **Why a Lakehouse Architecture Fits MonFin**

### **1. Data Aggregation from Multiple Sources**
- MonFin requires integrating data from **diverse sources** (e.g., KBO, NBB, ANG, FOD Fin, FOD SZ). A lakehouse can handle:
  - **Structured data** (e.g., company registries, financial records).
  - **Semi-structured data** (e.g., JSON/XML from APIs).
  - **Unstructured data** (e.g., police reports, text documents).
- The lakehouse architecture allows you to ingest and store all this data in its raw form, then process and transform it as needed.

---

### **2. Scalability for Large Datasets**
- Belgium has **1.14 million companies**, and MonFin needs to process and analyze data for all of them. A lakehouse architecture is designed to handle **large-scale data** efficiently, making it ideal for this use case.
- You can scale storage and compute resources independently, which is cost-effective and flexible.

---

### **3. Advanced Analytics and Machine Learning**
- MonFin aims to use **indicators and scoring mechanisms** to flag suspicious companies. A lakehouse architecture supports:
  - **Machine learning (ML)**: Train models to detect patterns of fraud or money laundering.
  - **Real-time analytics**: Monitor data streams for immediate insights.
  - **Proactive analysis**: Identify criminal networks and trends over time.
- Tools like **Apache Spark**, **Delta Lake**, and **MLflow** (commonly used in lakehouse architectures) are perfect for these tasks.

---

### **4. Customizable Dashboards and Queries**
- MonFin requires a **user-friendly dashboard** for police units to visualize data and run custom queries. A lakehouse architecture supports:
  - **SQL-based querying**: Enables police analysts to run ad-hoc queries on structured data.
  - **Data visualization tools**: Integrates with tools like **Power BI**, **Tableau**, or **Apache Superset** for dashboards.
  - **Custom scoring mechanisms**: Allows police units to adjust indicators and weights based on regional needs.

---

### **5. Interoperability with Existing Systems**
- MonFin needs to integrate with other police tools and systems. A lakehouse architecture is highly interoperable:
  - **APIs and connectors**: Easily connect to external systems (e.g., ANG, FOD Fin).
  - **Data sharing**: Share data securely with other law enforcement agencies or partners.
  - **Modularity**: Add new data sources or functionalities without disrupting existing workflows.

---

### **6. Security and Compliance**
- Since MonFin deals with **sensitive police data**, an on-premises lakehouse ensures:
  - **Data sovereignty**: Data remains within the police infrastructure.
  - **Compliance**: Meets strict data privacy and security regulations (e.g., GDPR).
  - **Access control**: Restrict access to authorized personnel only.

## **Proposed On-Premises Lakehouse Architecture for MonFin with dbt**

### **1. Data Ingestion Layer**
- **Purpose**: Ingest data from multiple sources (KBO, NBB, ANG, FOD Fin, etc.).
- **Tools**:
  - **Apache Kafka** for real-time data streaming.
  - **Apache NiFi** for batch data ingestion.
  - **On-premises ETL tools** like **Talend** or **Pentaho**.

---

### **2. Storage Layer**
- **Purpose**: Store raw and processed data in a scalable, secure manner.
- **Tools**:
  - **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)** or **MinIO** for scalable, on-premises object storage.
  - **Apache Iceberg** or **Delta Lake** as the **table format** to manage metadata and enable advanced features like schema evolution, time travel, and efficient querying.

---

### **3. Transformation Layer with dbt**
- **Purpose**: Transform raw data into clean, structured datasets for analysis.
- **Tools**:
  - **dbt (Data Build Tool)**: 
    - Use dbt to define **SQL-based transformations** in a modular and reusable way.
    - Leverage dbt's **version control** and **testing capabilities** to ensure data quality.
    - Create **data models** that aggregate, join, and enrich data from multiple sources.
  - **dbt Core**: Use the open-source version of dbt for on-premises deployment.
  - **dbt Cloud**: If preferred, use dbt Cloud for a managed experience (requires internet access, so ensure compliance with security policies).

---

### **4. Analytics and Machine Learning Layer**
- **Purpose**: Perform advanced analytics, scoring, and machine learning.
- **Tools**:
  - **MLflow** for managing machine learning models.
  - **Scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow**, or **PyTorch** for building fraud detection models.
  - **Jupyter Notebooks** for data exploration and model development.

---

### **5. Visualization and Query Layer**
- **Purpose**: Enable police units to visualize data and run custom queries.
- **Tools**:
  - **Power BI** or **Tableau** for dashboards (on-premises versions).
  - **Apache Superset** for open-source data visualization.
  - **Presto** or **Trino** for SQL-based querying.

---

### **6. Security and Governance Layer**
- **Purpose**: Ensure data security, compliance, and governance.
- **Tools**:
  - **Access Control for Object Storage**:
    - **MinIO Access Control**: Use MinIO's built-in **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** and **Bucket Policies** to control access to object storage.
    - **Open Policy Agent (OPA)**: A flexible, open-source tool for policy-based access control across multiple systems, including MinIO.
  - **Data Governance**:
    - **Apache Atlas** for metadata management and data lineage.
  - **Data Quality**:
    - **Great Expectations** or **Deequ** for data quality checks.

## **Benefits of Using dbt in MonFin**
1. **Modular and Reusable Transformations**:
   - Define transformations in **SQL** and organize them into modular data models.
   - Reuse models across different parts of the pipeline.
2. **Data Quality and Testing**:
   - Use dbt's built-in **testing framework** to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
   - Validate data at every stage of the transformation process.
3. **Version Control**:
   - Track changes to data models using **Git**, enabling collaboration and rollback if needed.
4. **Documentation**:
   - Automatically generate **data documentation** to help police analysts understand the data.
5. **Scalability**:
   - dbt works seamlessly with scalable data warehouses and lakehouse architectures.

## **Next Steps**
1. **Evaluate On-Premises Infrastructure**:
   - Assess existing hardware and storage capabilities.
   - Plan for scaling storage and compute resources as needed.
2. **Set Up dbt**:
   - Install **dbt Core** on your on-premises infrastructure.
   - Configure dbt to connect to your data storage (e.g., HDFS, MinIO) and table format (e.g., Apache Iceberg, Delta Lake).
3. **Develop a Proof of Concept (PoC)**:
   - Build a small-scale lakehouse with dbt to test data ingestion, transformation, and visualization for MonFin.
4. **Engage Stakeholders**:
   - Work with police units to define requirements for dashboards, scoring mechanisms, and data sources.
5. **Implement Security Measures**:
   - Set up access control, encryption, and auditing to ensure data security and compliance.
